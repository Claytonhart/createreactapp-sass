## Cryptocurrency Dashboard (WIP)

Live version currently hosted at [Cryptocurrency Dashboard](https://claytonhart.github.io/cryptocurrency/)

Cryptocurrency Dashboard is my current project as of Sept. 26, 2018

Styling (not responsive yet) and the initial Dashboard section are complete, excluding the wallet components and transaction pie chart. The initial dashboard load makes multiple requests to the [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/). Although the app has the potential to allow user login, I think it would be too much to ask that anyone reviewing this project trust the app with any personal info regarding personal financial information. As a result, I will likely only extend functionality as far as the API will allow anonymous interactions.
